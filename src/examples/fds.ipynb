Legbreak with the seam pointing towards backward point, it drifted in to land around off and hit low on the pad. Young\\'s bat flicked the pad and missed the ball. Height and line not an issue, that is goodnight nurse. Hawk-Eye shows it\\'d go on to smash middle and leg. Varun pumps his fist like a boxer, slaps a high-five to KL Rahul. 57/137.5 to GD Phillips, Chakravarthy rips one in, dinks middle and off. Safe to say Phillips didn\\'t read the 92ks googly. Reverse cross-seamer on a length landed just outside off and Phillips was in the crease shaping for the cut, went through with it feebly. Knew he had no time to adjust, ball snuck below bat and hit the stumps hard.. 165/5 Previous0:310:34 NextSee all videosSee all photosKuldeep Yadav1004024.0034211010.1 to R Ravindra, Googly to clatter the stumps, a special ball to dismiss a special batter! 84ks back-of-hander landed a touch back of length around a fourth-stump line, Ravindra shaped to play on the off side but was cramped for room. He had to adjust his shot late but the pace off the pitch didn\\'t allow him to do that, the front toe was pointing up, the bat was neither horizontal nor vertical as he tried to fend last minute; pad got tickled, top of off got smashed. Kuldeep leaps in the air, gets a headlock from Rahul, lots of hugs too. He\\'s broken the game open with his first ball. 69/212.2 to KS Williamson, Spooned back, dolly for Kuldeep. He runs back with his index finger up, gets big hugs from his team-mates, big pop from the crowd too. New Zealand\\'s top order is gone! Stock ball was full on 82ks, around off stump, Williamson lunged across for a flick. Might\\'ve wanted to run it to long-on. Not sure if it dipped but KW seemed to be early on the shot. Played well in front of the body, lobbed it to the bowler\\'s right. Batter shakes his head while looking back up.. 75/3 Previous0:290:29 NextSee all videosSee all photosAxar Patel802903.62251010Ravindra Jadeja1003013.0035100023.2 to TWM Latham, Oh, he\\'s caught in front and the umpire\\'s finger is up in an instant. That looked plumb on first viewing. But Latham has reviewed.  Flatter on middle, Latham goes for a sweep, misses and is caught bang in front. The replays confirm the ball would have crashed into off stump. Latham departs and takes a review with him.

Pandya is rushed into the pull and can only manage a top-edge that goes straight up and is held by Jamieson with ease. 241/60:26See all videosSee all photosWill O’Rourke705608.00156030Nathan Smith2022011.0062200Mitchell Santner1004624.6034221018.4 to Shubman Gill, Has anyone seen Superman and Phillips in the same room? I doubt it. He has just caught another blinder. And this one really is an absolute blinder. Floated outside off, he looks to go up and over GP at short extra cover. That was a boundary if anyone else was there. Not when GP is there. He leaps, flicks out his right hand and hangs on to a stunner. Flashes a big smile right after.. 105/138.4 to SS Iyer, In the air and taken by Ravindra sprinting to his left from short fine leg. That is a lovely catch by him diving low. Stifle short on middle stump, he gets across looking to pull this fine, gets it off the splice. Rachin moves beautifully to his left and grabs this inches off the turf. 183/4 Previous0:24 NextSee all videosSee all photosRachin Ravindra1014714.7030121026.1 to RG Sharma, The Squeeze. IS. ON! In fact, NZ have squeezed water out of stone. Rohit dances down and gets stumped! Huge moment, he waslks back with his head down for most of the way back. Applause from the crowd but NZ are well in the game now. First ball of the over, Rohit looked to manufacture a boundary. Was a shortish ball outside off that spun away, was a pre-meditated shot from Rohit. He charged down and tried to slap it over cover. 122/30:20See all videosSee all photosMichael Bracewell1012822.8039010019.1 to V Kohli, He\\'s rapped on the pad first ball and the umpire is given it out. Oh, wow, that\\'s a big decision. Will Kohli review? He has to, almost and he does. Tossed up outside off turning back into Kohli who misses the flick and is caught in front. That looks plumb on first viewing. What does the tracker say? Struck in line - yes. Going onto hit the stumps - Oh, yes! Bracewell is pumped up and NZ suddenly have an opening. 106/241.3 to AR Patel, Axar falls and Bracewell has another one. That\\'s not Axar\\'s best moment, I must add. Floated on off stump, he takes a couple of steps down the track and looks to go over long-off. Completely mis-hits this and O\\'Rourke takes a safe catch.. 203/5See all photosGlenn Phillips503106.2081100Unlocking the magic of StatsguruMatch FlowNew Zealand inningsPowerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 10.0 (Mandatory - 69 runs, 1 wicket)New Zealand: 50 runs in 6.6 overs (42 balls), Extras 71st Wicket: 50 runs in 42 balls (WA Young 15, R Ravindra 29, Ex 7)Over 7.0: Review by New Zealand (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - R Ravindra (Upheld)Powerplay 2: Overs 10.1 - 40.0 (Mandatory - 103 runs, 4 wickets)Drinks: New Zealand - 83/3 in 15.0 overs (DJ Mitchell 9, TWM Latham 2)New Zealand: 100 runs in 19.2 overs (116 balls), Extras 9Over 21.4: Review by India (Bowling), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - TWM Latham (Struck down)Over 23.2: Review by New Zealand (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - TWM Latham (Struck down)New Zealand: 150 runs in 34.3 overs (207 balls), Extras 10Drinks: New Zealand - 156/4 in 36.0 overs (DJ Mitchell 41, GD Phillips 28)5th Wicket: 50 runs in 79 balls (DJ Mitchell 21, GD Phillips 29, Ex 1)Powerplay 3: Overs 40.1 - 50.0 (Mandatory - 79 runs, 2 wickets)DJ Mitchell: 50 off 91 balls (1 x 4)New Zealand: 200 runs in 44.4 overs (268 balls), Extras 13MG Bracewell: 50 off 39 balls (3 x 4, 2 x 6)New Zealand: 250 runs in 49.6 overs (300 balls), Extras 16Innings Break: New Zealand - 251/7 in 50.0 overs (MG Bracewell 53, NG Smith 0)India inningsPowerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 10.0 (Mandatory - 64 runs, 0 wicket)India: 50 runs in 7.2 overs (44 balls), Extras 51st Wicket: 50 runs in 44 balls (RG Sharma 39, Shubman Gill 7, Ex 5)Powerplay 2: Overs 10.1 - 40.0 (Mandatory - 127 runs, 4 wickets)RG Sharma: 50 off 41 balls (5 x 4, 3 x 6)India: 100 runs in 16.6 overs (102 balls), Extras 51st Wicket: 100 runs in 102 balls (RG Sharma 68, Shubman Gill 27, Ex 5)Drinks: India - 103/0 in 18.0 overs (RG Sharma 69, Shubman Gill 29)Over 19.1: Review by India (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - V Kohli (Struck down)India: 150 runs in 32.5 overs (197 balls), Extras 54th Wicket: 50 runs in 62 balls (SS Iyer 35, AR Patel 16, Ex 0)Drinks: India - 183/3 in 38.0 overs (SS Iyer 48, AR Patel 22)Powerplay 3: Overs 40.1 - 50.0 (Mandatory - 63 runs, 2 wickets)India: 200 runs in 40.5 overs (245 balls), Extras 5India: 250 runs in 48.5 overs (293 balls), Extras 8Match DetailsDubai International Cricket StadiumTossNew Zealand, elected to bat firstSeriesICC Champions TrophySeason2024/25Player Of The MatchRohit SharmaPlayer Of The SeriesRachin RavindraSeries resultIndia won the 2024/25 ICC Champions Trophy Match numberODI no. 4858Hours of play (local time)14.00 start, First Session 14.00-17.30, Interval 17.30-18.10, Second Session 18.10-21.40Match days9 March 2025 - daynight (50-over match)UmpiresPaul ReiffelDRSRichard IllingworthDRSTV UmpireJoel WilsonReserve UmpireKumar DharmasenaMatch RefereeRanjan MadugalleLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityIND\\xa0100%NZIND100%50%100%NZ InningsIND InningsOver 49\\xa0•\\xa0IND 254/6India won by 4 wickets (with 6 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match News23/24: How Rohit Sharma and his Indian team have been dominating ICC tournamentsThe India of 2023-25 have enjoyed one of the most dominant periods for any men\\'s team at ICC tournaments.

He had to adjust his shot late but the pace off the pitch didn't allow him to do that, the front toe was pointing up, the bat was neither horizontal nor vertical as he tried to fend last minute; pad got tickled, top of off got smashed. Kuldeep leaps in the air, gets a headlock from Rahul, lots of hugs too. He's broken the game open with his first ball . 69 / 2 12.2 to KS Williamson , Spooned back, dolly for Kuldeep . He runs back with his index finger up, gets big hugs from his team-mates, big pop from the crowd too. New Zealand's top order is gone! Stock ball was full on 82ks, around off stump, Williamson lunged across for a flick. Might've wanted to run it to long-on. Not sure if it dipped but KW seemed to be early on the shot. Played well in front of the body, lobbed it to the bowler's right. Batter shakes his head while looking back up. . 75 / 3 Previous 0:29 0:29 Next See all videos See all photos Axar Patel 8 0 29 0 3.62 25 1 0 1 0 Ravindra Jadeja 10 0 30 1 3.00 35 1 0 0 0 23.2 to TWM Latham , Oh, he's caught in front and the umpire's finger is up in an instant. That looked plumb on first viewing. But Latham has reviewed. Flatter on middle, Latham goes for a sweep, misses and is caught bang in front. The replays confirm the ball would have crashed into off stump. Latham departs and takes a review with him. NZ in deep, deep trouble. . 108 / 4 0:41 See all videos See all photos India (T: 252 runs from 50 ovs) Batting R B M 4s 6s SR Rohit Sharma (c) st †Latham b Ravindra 76 83 102 7 3 91.56 Shubman Gill c Phillips b Santner 31 50 75 0 1 62.00 Virat Kohli lbw b Bracewell 1 2 4 0 0 50.00 Shreyas Iyer c Ravindra b Santner 48 62 68 2 2 77.41 Axar Patel c O'Rourke b Bracewell 29 40 58 1 1 72.50 KL Rahul † not out 34 33 47 1 1 103.03 Hardik Pandya c & b Jamieson 18 18 27 1 1 100.00 Ravindra Jadeja not out 9 6 7 1 0 150.00 Extras (w 8) 8 Total 49 Ov (RR: 5.18) 254 /6 Did not bat: Mohammed Shami , Kuldeep Yadav , Varun Chakravarthy Fall of wickets : 1 - 105 ( Shubman Gill , 18.4 ov ) , 2 - 106 ( Virat Kohli , 19.1 ov ) , 3 - 122 ( Rohit Sharma , 26.1 ov ) , 4 - 183 ( Shreyas Iyer , 38.4 ov ) , 5 - 203 ( Axar Patel , 41.3 ov ) , 6 - 241 ( Hardik Pandya , 47.3 ov ) • DRS Bowling O M R W ECON 0s 4s 6s WD NB Kyle Jamieson 5 0 24 1 4.80 19 1 1 1 0 47.3 to HH Pandya , Straight up and taken by Jamieson. Is it not over yet? Sharp bouncer shoulder-high on off. Pandya is rushed into the pull and can only manage a top-edge that goes straight up and is held by Jamieson with ease . 241 / 6 0:26 See all videos See all photos Will O’Rourke 7 0 56 0 8.00 15 6 0 3 0 Nathan Smith 2 0 22 0 11.00 6 2 2 0 0 Mitchell Santner 10 0 46 2 4.60 34 2 2 1 0 18.4 to Shubman Gill , Has anyone seen Superman and Phillips in the same room? I doubt it. He has just caught another blinder. And this one really is an absolute blinder. Floated outside off, he looks to go up and over GP at short extra cover. That was a boundary if anyone else was there. Not when GP is there. He leaps, flicks out his right hand and hangs on to a stunner. Flashes a big smile right after. . 105 / 1 38.4 to SS Iyer , In the air and taken by Ravindra sprinting to his left from short fine leg. That is a lovely catch by him diving low. Stifle short on middle stump, he gets across looking to pull this fine, gets it off the splice. Rachin moves beautifully to his left and grabs this inches off the turf . 183 / 4 Previous 0:24 Next See all videos See all photos Rachin Ravindra 10 1 47 1 4.70 30 1 2 1 0 26.1 to RG Sharma , The Squeeze. IS. ON! In fact, NZ have squeezed water out of stone . Rohit dances down and gets stumped! Huge moment, he waslks back with his head down for most of the way back. Applause from the crowd but NZ are well in the game now. First ball of the over, Rohit looked to manufacture a boundary. Was a shortish ball outside off that spun away, was a pre-meditated shot from Rohit. He charged down and tried to slap it over cover . 122 / 3 0:20 See all videos See all photos Michael Bracewell 10 1 28 2 2.80 39 0 1 0 0 19.1 to V Kohli , He's rapped on the pad first ball and the umpire is given it out. Oh, wow, that's a big decision. Will Kohli review? He has to, almost and he does. Tossed up outside off turning back into Kohli who misses the flick and is caught in front. That looks plumb on first viewing. What does the tracker say? Struck in line - yes. Going onto hit the stumps - Oh, yes! Bracewell is pumped up and NZ suddenly have an opening . 106 / 2 41.3 to AR Patel , Axar falls and Bracewell has another one. That's not Axar's best moment, I must add. Floated on off stump, he takes a couple of steps down the track and looks to go over long-off. Completely mis-hits this and O'Rourke takes a safe catch. . 203 / 5 See all photos Glenn Phillips 5 0 31 0 6.20 8 1 1 0 0 Unlocking the magic of Statsguru Match Flow New Zealand innings Powerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 10.0 (Mandatory - 69 runs, 1 wicket) New Zealand: 50 runs in 6.6 overs (42 balls), Extras 7 1st Wicket: 50 runs in 42 balls (WA Young 15, R Ravindra 29, Ex 7) Over 7.0: Review by New Zealand (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - R Ravindra (Upheld) Powerplay 2: Overs 10.1 - 40.0 (Mandatory - 103 runs, 4 wickets) Drinks: New Zealand - 83/3 in 15.0 overs (DJ Mitchell 9, TWM Latham 2) New Zealand: 100 runs in 19.2 overs (116 balls), Extras 9 Over 21.4: Review by India (Bowling), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - TWM Latham (Struck down) Over 23.2: Review by New Zealand (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - TWM Latham (Struck down) New Zealand: 150 runs in 34.3 overs (207 balls), Extras 10 Drinks: New Zealand - 156/4 in 36.0 overs (DJ Mitchell 41, GD Phillips 28) 5th Wicket: 50 runs in 79 balls (DJ Mitchell 21, GD Phillips 29, Ex 1) Powerplay 3: Overs 40.1 - 50.0 (Mandatory - 79 runs, 2 wickets) DJ Mitchell: 50 off 91 balls (1 x 4) New Zealand: 200 runs in 44.4 overs (268 balls), Extras 13 MG Bracewell: 50 off 39 balls (3 x 4, 2 x 6) New Zealand: 250 runs in 49.6 overs (300 balls), Extras 16 Innings Break: New Zealand - 251/7 in 50.0 overs (MG Bracewell 53, NG Smith 0) India innings Powerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 10.0 (Mandatory - 64 runs, 0 wicket) India: 50 runs in 7.2 overs (44 balls), Extras 5 1st Wicket: 50 runs in 44 balls (RG Sharma 39, Shubman Gill 7, Ex 5) Powerplay 2: Overs 10.1 - 40.0 (Mandatory - 127 runs, 4 wickets) RG Sharma: 50 off 41 balls (5 x 4, 3 x 6) India: 100 runs in 16.6 overs (102 balls), Extras 5 1st Wicket: 100 runs in 102 balls (RG Sharma 68, Shubman Gill 27, Ex 5) Drinks: India - 103/0 in 18.0 overs (RG Sharma 69, Shubman Gill 29) Over 19.1: Review by India (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - PR Reiffel, Batter - V Kohli (Struck down) India: 150 runs in 32.5 overs (197 balls), Extras 5 4th Wicket: 50 runs in 62 balls (SS Iyer 35, AR Patel 16, Ex 0) Drinks: India - 183/3 in 38.0 overs (SS Iyer 48, AR Patel 22) Powerplay 3: Overs 40.1 - 50.0 (Mandatory - 63 runs, 2 wickets) India: 200 runs in 40.5 overs (245 balls), Extras 5 India: 250 runs in 48.5 overs (293 balls), Extras 8 Match Details Dubai International Cricket Stadium Toss New Zealand, elected to bat first Series ICC Champions Trophy Season 2024/25 Player Of The Match Rohit Sharma Player Of The Series Rachin Ravindra Series result India won the 2024/25 ICC Champions Trophy Match number ODI no. 4858 Hours of play (local time) 14.00 start, First Session 14.00-17.30, Interval 17.30-18.10, Second Session 18.10-21.40 Match days 9 March 2025 - daynight (50-over match) Umpires Paul Reiffel DRS Richard Illingworth DRS TV Umpire Joel Wilson Reserve Umpire Kumar Dharmasena Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle Language English Win Probability IND 100% NZ IND 100% 50% 100% NZ Innings IND Innings Over 49 • IND 254/6 India won by 4 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) Powered by Smart Stats Match Coverage All Match News Gill, Rohit and Kohli in top five of ICC's ODI batting rankings The team made gains on the bowling rankings as well with Kuldeep Yadav ranked third and Jadeja tenth 23/24: How Rohit Sharma and his Indian team have been dominating ICC tournaments The India of 2023-25 have enjoyed one of the most dominant periods for any men's team at ICC tournaments.
